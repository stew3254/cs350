**Team Name:** Condor

**Report Number:** 8

**Reporting Week:** 10/18

**Summary of work completed in prior week:**

We worked on fixing the requirements document and Ryan tried to set up the initial implementation of the project. Edits were made to try to make it fit the Split Pay document a lot more closely.

**Summary of work planned for next week:**

I will make sure the implementation of the project starts working with the help of Jacob and we will get the edits for the requirements document ideally mostly done. Weâ€™ll probably also look at the design document and presentation.

**Open issues and action plan to resolve them:**

We need to fix our requirements document and we are working on making it model split pay much more closely than before.
