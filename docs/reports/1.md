Team Name: Condor
Report Number: 1
Reporting Week: 8/30

### Summary of work completed in prior week:

We started communication about what this project will entail. We collectively decided to use Python and the Django framework when we eventually work on the application. We agreed upon a team name and have a plan to meet to discuss the bidding and interviews nearing us. Ryan set up a git repository and team site. Jacob set up the group workspace on slack and a bare-bones Django site. This includes a model, some views and a hello world page.

### Summary of work planned for next week:

Meet once again to discuss plans for bidding. We would also like to touch upon interviews and discuss the process to do that. We’ll also ensure the team site is working properly.

### Open issues and action plan to resolve them: 

 Come up with a better system for scheduling meetings. We will communicate and find at least 1 time each week that we can all meet to discuss project related matters.

9/5/21 19:30 in the ITL – Jacob, Jonathan and Ryan worked on the report and came up with a team name. Kaitlyn agreed via Slack. Ryan started to work on github pages. We also said we would probably like to do recipe buddy, but did not get total group approval over majorizer. Those two will be the two for bidding though. We also agreed on having another meeting on 9/6/21 19:30 in the ITL to discuss bidding and possibly interviews.
