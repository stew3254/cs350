**Team Name:** Condor

**Report Number:** 7

**Reporting Week:** 10/11

**Summary of work completed in prior week:**

We completed what needed to be done for the requirements document.
Nothing else was worked on this week.

**Summary of work planned for next week:**

We will hopefully get feedback on the document and start to fix it before working on the design
document and finalizing some UI designs. It's important to wait for feedback so we know
what we should focus on.

**Open issues and action plan to resolve them:**

None that come to mind. We still seem to be on schedule with the class so far.
